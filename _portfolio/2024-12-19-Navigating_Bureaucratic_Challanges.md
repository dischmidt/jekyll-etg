The client decided on short notice to participate in a trade fair in Germany—just five weeks away. This posed a challenge due to the lengthy bureaucracy in Germany. Besides the standard procedure, faster alternative solutions also needed to be explored. 

One shipment of accessories initially got stuck in customs. Fortunately, having multiple shipments helped. 

Customs issues can often be resolved easily, provided one is willing to spend money. However, customs problems rarely come alone. Since the client aims to penetrate the German market for the long term, this wasn't a major setback. The success at the fair speaks volumes. Nevertheless, it required considerable effort—and sometimes led to wasted attempts. It’s great when the goal is finally achieved.
