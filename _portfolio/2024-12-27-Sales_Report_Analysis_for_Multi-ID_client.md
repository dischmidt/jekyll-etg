Due to a change in sales structure several months ago, he ended up with more VAT IDs than necessary—exceeding the allowed number in some countries and surpassing the capability - as well as rules - of his large marketplace provider's software.

Occasionally, unexpected issues arise. A client was trading online across several European countries, utilizing various VAT IDs. Due to a change in sales structure several months ago, he ended up with more VAT IDs than necessary—exceeding the allowed number in some countries and surpassing the capability - as well as rules - of his large marketplace provider's software. 

This situation required a comprehensive reevaluation of two years' worth of sales data. An extensive data analysis process was essential for VAT reporting, including collection, cleaning, analysis, and presenting usable figures that made sense. 

To address this, we developed a small software solution to streamline the task, moving away from conventional spreadsheet calculations. The tax advisors form several countries obviously did not complain.
