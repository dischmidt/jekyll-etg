<h2 id="content">Standardised Yet Tailored</h2>
<p>Although many aspects of compliance can be standardised, each businessâ€™s unique situation necessitates a customised service package. Fragmenting a mandatory checklist for engaging with German consumers and ensuring ongoing compliance results in an unclear list. We aim at transparency and trust, not on ambigiouty.</p>
<p>EuroTrade Gateway UG (hb) has thus opted to provide packages by country. We have categorised countries into groups to outline the essential steps for registration, reporting, and other compliance-related tasks, including taxation and extended producer responsibilities. We are happy to clarify our pricing and create customised offers upon request.
</p>
<p><i>If you are not sure where your business resides or what its jurisdictions is, we define residency by the residendy of the mangement - the legal representative, managing director or CEO.</i></p>

                Mandatory for nearly everyone selling physical items to German consumers. Registration at the German Packaging Register (LUCID) is required, along with regular reporting of packaging quantities. EuroTrade Gateway UG is officially licensed as an Authorised Representative for LUCID.
            </td>
            <td>
                Required for businesses importing electronics or electric equipment to Germany. This involves compliance with the Waste Electronics and Electric Equipment (WEEE) directive. EuroTrade Gateway UG (hb) offers representation but works with specialized agencies for initial registrations. Limited representation is provided for larger setups.
            </td>
            <td>
                Importing electronics often involves batteries. If fewer than 100 items are imported, consider removing batteries before shipping to Germany. Battery disposal charges are low, but administrative fees are high, nearly equal to WEEE costs. Registration is essential for compliance with the German Battery Act (BattG).
