# Your Partner for Cross-Border Compliance

### Comprehensive Compliance Solutions for International Businesses

EuroTrade Gateway UG is a specialized service provider simplifying regulatory compliance for international businesses operating in Germany and the European Union. With expertise in packaging, electronics, battery compliance, and VAT registration, we help businesses navigate complex administrative processes efficiently and cost-effectively.  

Our services cater to companies of all sizes selling physical goods in Germany or across the EU. Whether you are an established retailer, a growing e-commerce business, or an international manufacturer expanding into European markets, we provide tailored solutions to meet your legal obligations.  

### Tailored Services for Packaging, Electronics, and Batteries

For businesses selling to German consumers, compliance with the **German Packaging Act (LUCID)** is mandatory. EuroTrade Gateway UG is officially licensed as an Authorised Representative for the LUCID packaging register. We assist with registration, reporting packaging quantities, and contracting appropriate disposal system participants. This ensures full compliance with environmental regulations while preparing businesses for potential expansion into other EU markets.  

If your business imports electronics, our **WEEE services** (Waste Electronics and Electric Equipment) are essential. We work with specialized agencies for initial registration and provide ongoing reporting to ensure compliance. For businesses with larger setups, we also offer representation services to handle WEEE requirements.  

Similarly, if your products include batteries, compliance with the **German Battery Act (BattG)** is critical. We provide expert guidance on registration, reporting, and managing disposal charges. Recognizing the high administrative fees, we recommend aligning battery and WEEE registrations to streamline the process.  

### Simplifying VAT Registration and Regulatory Workflows

Additionally, we assist businesses with **VAT ID registration**, a fundamental requirement for operating in Germany or the EU. From obtaining VAT IDs to providing live assistance for German tax portal registration, our services ensure businesses meet their VAT reporting obligations smoothly. We assist in setting-up workflows with self-reporting.

EuroTrade Gateway UG enables businesses to focus on growth while we handle regulatory complexities. With transparent, efficient, and reliable services, we are your trusted partner for establishing and expanding your presence in Germany and the European Union. Let us manage compliance so you can concentrate on your customers and success.
