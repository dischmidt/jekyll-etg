			<h2>EU Market Access</h2>

The European Union is a customs club. But further more, the European Union is a whole market regime. This regimes defines trade rules and environmental standards. Some of them are directly enforced by the EU, some of them are controlled by the national governments. In this multi-level setup of rules, the EU defines a minimum.</p>
	<p>There are extended producers responsibilities (EPR) in all EU countries, e.g. for product packaging and shipping packaging. But there may country specific thresholds. And the administrative procedures differ at lot. Administrative requirements can be a real trade barrierer. It takes time, knowledge and money to tear down these barrieres. Here our work kicks in.</p>

					<h3>CE Marking</h3>
				</header>
	            <p>CE marking indicates that a product complies with EU safety, health, and environmental protection standards. It must appear on products sold in the EU to ensure consumer safety and streamline market access. The manufacturer or authorized representative is responsible for placing the CE marking. Compliance is crucial for successful entry into EU markets. UKCA is the eqquivalent mark for prodcuts sold in the United Kingdom. </p>
	            <p>Most of our customers are retailers whose goods already have the CE mark affixed by the manufacturer.</p>

					<h3>VAT Compliance</h3>
				</header>
				<p>When exporting products to final consumers in the EU, UK, or Switzerland, foreign producers and e-merchants must first register for VAT. This registration is mandatory if goods are stored in local warehouses or fulfillment centers and will be sold to consumers. Alternatively, the One Stop Shop (OSS) scheme simplifies VAT reporting, allowing sellers to manage obligations through a single national tax office for multiple EU countries.
				<p>Even if a sale is already possible under national law without the VAT ID already being available, this encounters considerable problems in reality and on trading platforms. In fact, a VAT ID must be available before the sale can begin. Depending on national legislation, a fiscal representation or receiving agent residing in the EU must be appointed.</p>

					<h3>Customs Registration</h3>
				</header>
				<p>International e-merchants shipping to the EU should consider customs compliance and EORI registration (Economic Operators Registration and Identification). Freight forwarders typically handle customs declarations and import VAT. Although not mandatory, having your own EORI can facilitate tax deductions and streamline the import process. Note that businesses from non-EU countries may not have an entitlement to EORI issuance.</p>

					<h3>Packaging Directive</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The European Packaging Directive establishes regulations for packaging waste management across EU countries. While there is a shared framework, each country has unique administrative requirements, particularly in Germany. International e-merchants entering the EU market must comply with these local regulations to avoid fines.</p> 
				<p>EuroTrade Gateway UG (hb) acts as an authorized representative for the German packaging register LUCID and connects clients with disposal system participants, ensuring compliance with the German Packaging Act for reporting, record keeping and recycling obligations. Our partners operate in several EU countries.</p>

					<h3>Extended Producer Responsibilities</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) in the EU extends beyond mandatory packaging rules to specific products like electronics and batteries. Each country has regulations for waste management under WEEE and for recycling both built-in and supplementary batteries. EuroTrade Gateway partners facilitate compliance by coordinating VAT, packaging, WEEE, and battery reporting, while also offering additional country-specific registrations, including for cosmetics, upon request.
